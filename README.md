Tiny apps either made through following a tutorial on Udemy or YouTube, or given as an assignment in one of the online classes I'm taking on Udemy.
All of this is just meant to upload the things that I'm trying to improve on / learning. None of this is meant to be considered any sort of 'real' project,
and is purely just a way for me to track what it is that I'm doing, and to see when progress is being made.

//NOT TO BE LOOKED AT - FEEL FREE TO VIEW OTHER REPOS (though as of right now, those apps are kind of silly and provide no real value as well)//
